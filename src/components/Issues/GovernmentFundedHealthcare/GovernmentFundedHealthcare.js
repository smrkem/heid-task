  image_filename: 'issue-government-funded-healthcare.jpg',
  description: [
    "This topic focuses on whether healthcare is a basic human right, whether should be provided by the government, and to what extent should the government provide free healthcare. In Canada, universal healthcare coverage extends to Canadian citizens and lawful residents. It does not cover prescription drugs, home care, long-term care, physiotherapy, psychological care, or dental care. Certain provinces provide additional healthcare benefits for youth, low-income families, and seniors. Employers may provide additional health insurance. Canada employs a single payer system, where most healthcare is provided by private healthcare professionals. The cost of the entire fee is paid for by the government at a fixed rate. Hospitals are publicly funded."

  pros: [
    "Privatizing healthcare will increase prices and cause economic strain on families. In 2007, about 62% of US bankruptcies were related to medical expenses.",
    "Privatizing healthcare would reduce the overall health and wellbeing of the country, as many individuals would not be able to afford private medical services.",
    "Universal healthcare enhances economic productivity by increasing overall health so more people can work and contribute to society as a whole.",
    "Government funded healthcare also reduces the strain of insurance coverage from businesses."
  ],
  cons: [
    "People with high incomes, and subsequently pay more taxes then those with lower incomes, should not be forced to pay the medical bills of others due to incongruent taxation.",
    "Privatized healthcare will provide higher quality services â€“ you pay for what you get. Not all healthcare providers are of the same quality.",
    "Practitioners should be allowed to charge what they believe is appropriate for their services.",
    "A right to healthcare causes an overuse of services while having to manage a rationing of resources."
