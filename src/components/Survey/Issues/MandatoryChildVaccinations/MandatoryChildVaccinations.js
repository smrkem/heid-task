  problem_statement: "Should it be required by law to vaccinate a child?",
  image_src: imgSrc,
  description: [
    "Vaccinations for children are recommended by Health Canada and the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC) in the US, and are mandatory in a few states and provinces for children entering public schools. Although adverse reactions to vaccines are rare, a number of opponents have argued that injecting questionable vaccine ingredients into a child may cause important long-term problems, including seizures, autism, and ADHD. As such, there has been a number of important debates on whether vaccines should be mandatory for children."    
  ],
  pros: [
    "The United Nations states that vaccines save 2.5 million children from preventable diseases (90%-99%) a year worldwide and save lives.",
    "Ingredients in vaccines are administered at safe dosages, and thus there should be no fear of harmful chemicals; adverse reactions are extremely rare (e.g., one per million vaccines).",
    "Vaccines save money because they are cheaper than treatment for an infectious disease.",
    "Vaccines have been the main driving force in eliminating diseases such as polio and small pox."    
  ],
  cons: [
    "The government should not intervene and enforce personal medical choices. This is especially problematic for some religious doctrines.",
    "Vaccines can sometimes cause serious and fatal side effects.",
     "Vaccines contain harmful ingredients - such as mercury, yeast proteins, and more -  which are believed to increase the risk of developing cardiac and mental impairments, such as autism, ADHD, kidney failure, and death.",
    "Pharmaceutical companies, FDA, and CDC should not be trusted to make and regulate safe vaccines, since they are driven by profit."
