    "This topic focuses on whether healthcare is a basic human right, whether should be provided/funded by the government, and to what extent should the government provide free healthcare. Here are a few arguments FOR and AGAINST government funded healthcare."
  ],
  pros: [
    "Privatizing healthcare will increase prices and cause economic strain on families. In 2007, about 62% of US bankruptcies were related to medical expenses.",
    "Privatizing healthcare would reduce the overall health and wellbeing of the country, as many individuals would not be able to afford private medical services.",
    "Universal healthcare enhances economic productivity by increasing overall health so more people can work and contribute to society as a whole.",
    "Government funded healthcare also reduces the strain of insurance coverage from businesses."
  ],
  cons: [
    "People with high incomes, and subsequently pay more taxes then those with lower incomes, should not be forced to pay the medical bills of others due to incongruent taxation.",
    "Privatized healthcare will provide higher quality services â€“ you pay for what you get. Not all healthcare providers are of the same quality.",
    "Practitioners should be allowed to charge what they believe is appropriate for their services.",
    "A right to healthcare causes an overuse of services while having to manage a rationing of resources."
