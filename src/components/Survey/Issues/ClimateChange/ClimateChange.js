  problem_statement: "Should policy be implemented to reduce human-caused negative environmental impact?",

  description: [
    "Climate change is controversial because of the implications it has for policy, business and environment. Temperatures have increased globally. This has created significant change globally. Many ecosystems, such as coral reefs or polar ice caps, are failing. The melting of the ice caps also creates a rise in sea levels, leading to flooding.There is also an increase in extreme weather. These are a few implications of climate change. The degree to which human activity influences climate change is debated. Those that support the notion that human activity is significantly responsible for climate change suggest policy change to counteract these effects. The opposition believes that human activity is nonsignificant on a global scale and that the increase in temperature is argued to be due to natural causes. Thus, they believe that policy changes do not need to be made in order to limit human activity."

  pros: [
    "In 2010 a study found that 97%-98% climate researchers most actively publishing in their field agreed that human activity is responsible for climate change.",
    "In 2013, a review of 11944 peer-reviewed studies on climate change found that only 78 studies (0.7%) explicitly rejected the notion that human activity was responsible for global warming.",
    "Human activity produces gases that become trapped in the atmosphere, causing a “greenhouse effect”, wherein the gases trap heat and cause global warming.",
    "The \"greenhouse effect\", is amplified beyond natural expectations because the rate of climate change is faster than what would naturally be produced due to human contribution."
  ],
  cons: [
    "In a 2013 review it was found that 66.7% of the climate research studies did not suggest that human activity was the source of climate change; Earth’s climate has naturally warmed and cooled throughout time.",
    "Recent trends do not differ from this as Earth's warming occurred before the increase of human-released carbon dioxide (i.e., pollution from cars/factories).",
    "Fluctuations in the ocean’s currents and the sun's heat are the major driving forces in global warming.  Since human activity is not a significant cause of climate change, policy changing human activity is unfounded."
