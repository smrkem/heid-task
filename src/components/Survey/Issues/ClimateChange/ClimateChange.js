  description: [
    "Climate change is controversial because of the implications it has for policy, business, and environment. Temperatures have increased globally. This has created significant change globally. Many ecosystems, such as coral reefs or polar ice caps, are failing. The melting of the ice caps also creates a rise in sea levels, leading to flooding. There is also an increase in extreme weather. These are a few implications of climate change. The degree to which human activity influences climate change is debated. Here are a few arguments FOR and AGAINST implementing more policy to reduce the human impact on global warming."
  ],
  pros: [
    "In 2010 a study found that 97%-98% climate researchers most actively publishing in their field agreed that human activity is responsible for climate change.",
    "In 2013, a review of 11944 peer-reviewed studies on climate change found that only 78 studies (0.7%) explicitly rejected the notion that human activity was responsible for global warming.",
    "Human activity produces gases that become trapped in the atmosphere, causing a “greenhouse effect” and global warming.",
    "The \"greenhouse effect\", is amplified beyond natural expectations; the rate of climate change is faster than what would naturally be produced."
  ],
  cons: [
    "In a 2013 review it was found that 66.7% of the climate research studies did not suggest that human activity was the source of climate change; Earth’s climate has naturally warmed and cooled throughout time.",
    "Earth's warming occurred before the increase of human-released carbon dioxide (i.e., pollution from cars/factories).",
    "Fluctuations in the ocean’s currents and the sun's heat are the major driving forces in global warming.",
    "Since human activity is not a significant cause of climate change, policy changing human activity is unfounded."
