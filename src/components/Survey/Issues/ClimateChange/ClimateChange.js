  description: [
    "Temperatures have increased globally, creating significant changes in many ecosystems. For instance, these temperature changes have exacerbated the melting of the ice caps, resulting in rising sea levels and more frequent flooding. The degree to which human activity influences climate change and whether the world requires stricter environmental policies to reduce this potentially human-caused damage is debated. Here are a few arguments presented by opposite sides of the debate."
  ],
  pros: [
    "In 2010 a study found that 97%-98% climate researchers most actively publishing in their field agreed that human activity is responsible for climate change.",
    "In 2013, a review of 11944 peer-reviewed studies on climate change found that only 78 studies (0.7%) explicitly rejected the notion that human activity was responsible for global warming.",
    "Human activity produces gases that become trapped in the atmosphere, causing a “greenhouse effect” and global warming.",
    "The \"greenhouse effect\", is amplified beyond natural expectations; the rate of climate change is faster than what would naturally be produced."
  ],
  cons: [
    "In a 2013 review it was found that 66.7% of the climate research studies did not suggest that human activity was the source of climate change; Earth’s climate has naturally warmed and cooled throughout time.",
    "Earth's warming occurred before the increase of human-released carbon dioxide (i.e., pollution from cars/factories).",
    "Fluctuations in the ocean’s currents and the sun's heat are the major driving forces in global warming.",
    "Since human activity is not a significant cause of climate change, policy changing human activity is unfounded."
