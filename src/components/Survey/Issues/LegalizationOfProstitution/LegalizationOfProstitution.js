  problem_statement: "Should sex work be legalized?",
  image_src: imgSrc,
  description: [
    "Prostitution is the act of performing sexual services for financial compensation. Females working in this industry are more likely to be victims of crime such as abuse and human trafficking. Due to its association with criminal activity, religious violations and general stigmatization, there is debate on whether the practice should be legal. Legalizing prostitution has implications for economics, health, safety, and human rights."
  ],
  pros: [
    "Sex workers would be better protected because they would be more comfortable in approaching law enforcement.",
    "Laws that regulate prostitution would include regular health checks, reducing the risk of sexually transmitted diseases.",
    "If consensual sex is legal, it does not make sense for consensual sex to become illegal due to the voluntary exchange of money.",
    "Prostitution is a multi-million dollar industry that will exist legally or illegally. As such, it makes economic sense to tax the practice."
  ],
  cons: [
    "The number of sex workers would increase, leading to more people being exposed to dangerous situations for both physical and mental trauma.",
    "Women would further be objectified, increasing the likelihood of abuse and inhibitIng the progression of women's rights.",
    "There are many religious beliefs that suggest prostitution is sinful and immoral.",
    "Just like illicit, recreational drug use, prostitution it is a harmful practice. Legalizing it for economic goals would be immoral."
