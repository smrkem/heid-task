  description: [
    "Vegetarianism refers to a lifestyle that seeks to eliminate the use of animal products in food, clothing, and other items because of health and ethical concerns. In the last couple of years, vegetarianism has increased in popularity, making many restaurants and shops around the world adapt to the changing dietary landscape. While many scientists and lay-people alike urge others to move towards a vegetarian lifestyle, the majority of people have reservations about whether to completely eliminate meat and other animal by-products from their everyday lives. Here are a few arguments FOR and AGAINST the move towards vegetarianism."
  ],
  pros: [
    "Well-planned vegetarian diets have been found to be better for health, as they lower cholesterol and blood pressure, and decrease the rates of heart disease, some types of cancer, and type 2 diabetes.",
    "Killing animals is not justified, and many of the animals on factory farms are killed prematurely. For example, cows can live for over 20 years, but on daily farms they are usually killed around the ages of 3-4 when milk production is no longer profitable.",
    "Animals living on factory farms have to endure disease-ridden and cramped conditions, where they experience constant fear, torture, and pain before being slaughtered.",
    "Meat and dairy industry places a huge burden on the environment. Farming is resource-intensive and uses about 70% of the Earthâ€™s freshwater. Additionally, factory farms contribute to global warming by releasing large amounts of greenhouse gases, such as methane, into the atmosphere."    
  ],
  cons: [
    "Vegetarianism is not synonymous with health. There is an incredible amount of processed soy that vegetarians rely on for protein, which can lead to infertility, digestive issues, and malabsorption.",
    "Vegetarians are often deficient in iron, vitamin B12, and omega 3s, which are essential to healthy functioning, and are found in abundance in meat products and fish. For example, inadequate intake of vitamin B12 can cause irreversible brain damage.",
    "Being vegetarian is not necessarily more ethical. Every day, plowing destroys the habitats of other animals such as mice, snakes, etc. The production of grain and vegetables requires large amounts of pesticides and fertilizers, which also have a negative impact on biodiversity.",
    "It may not be more sustainable. The grains grown to feed the cattle are usually GMO soy and corn, and those fields are also a major source of greenhouse gases, further contributing to water and air pollution."
