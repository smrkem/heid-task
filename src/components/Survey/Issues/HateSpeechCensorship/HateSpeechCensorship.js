  description: [
    "Recently, the United States has seen a major political polarization. In fact, it seems like at no other point in history has the nation been more divided. One of the issues specifically concerns freedom of speech. On the one hand, free speech is encouraged, and is a significant point in liberal ideology. On the other hand, there is the question of whether groups such as Neo-Nazis and alt-right should be allowed a voice and freedom to express their beliefs online and in public. Freedom of speech for “hate speech” vs. censorship of “hate speech” is a hot topic of debate. Here are a few arguments FOR and AGAINST censoring hate speech."
  ],
  pros: [
    "It protects certain groups from being maligned.",
    "Censorship limits potential situations of violence resulting from disagreements between groups and individuals.",
    "It can eliminate some detrimental concepts and ideas that could do harm.",
    "Confronting and censoring hate speech is not about controlling the conversation or taking away an individual’s right to free speech, but rather about being promoting inclusivity, and fostering growth, tolerance, and understanding."  
  ],
  cons: [
    "It’s hard to determine what “hate” is. For example, recently, Louis Farrakhan referred to Jews as “termites,” on Twitter, but no action was taken. Yet, many alt-right groups and individuals get banned from social media daily for voicing their opinions.",
    "Hate speech places limits on free speech and the exchange of ideas between people.",
    "As with Bill C-16 in Canada, not only does it limit one’s speech, but it also compels certain types of speech, like the required use of certain gender pronouns.",
    "Allowing everyone to express their opinions can lead to ideas being challenged, and people having a better understanding of others’ points of view."
