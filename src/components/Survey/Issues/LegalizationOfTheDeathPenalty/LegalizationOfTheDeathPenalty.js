  description: [
    "In the United States, capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is a government-sanctioned practice whereby a person is ordered to be killed by the state as a punishment for a crime. Crimes that are punishable by death commonly include murder, treason, espionage, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. The death penalty is a matter of active controversy in several countries and states, with positions varying from for or against the use of this practice for punishment. Here are a few arguments FOR and AGAINST the death sentence."
  ],
  pros: [
    "It is an effective method for preserving law and order â€“ both as a deterrent (out of fear for the death penalty, people do not commit murder or other heinous crimes) and by preventing offenders from repeating a crime.",
    "It is cheaper than life sentences, and helps console those affected by the crime, such as grieving families.",
    "The punishment fits the crime. The nature of their crime deserves the death penalty. Indeed, the death penalty is reserved for those that have committed only the most heinous (wicked) crimes. It selects the worst of the worst.",
    "The death penalty promotes belief in and respect for moral order within society."    
  ],
  cons: [
    "It has no deterrent on crime; there is no credible statistical evidence that capital punishment reduces the rate of murder.",
    "Wrongly gives governments the power to take human life and there is a risk of sentencing someone that is innocent to death.",
    "There are fundamental flaws within the legal system leading to wrongful convictions of potentially innocent peoples.",
    "Perpetuates social injustices by disproportionately targeting minorities (such as people of colour), or people that cannot afford a good attorney (classism)."
