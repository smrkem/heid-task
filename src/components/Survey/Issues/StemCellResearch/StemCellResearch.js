  description: [
    "Stem cells have been of particular research interest as they have a remarkable potential to develop into many different cell types in the body during early development. More importantly, they can renew themselves through cell division and become organ- or tissue-specific, repairing damaged or worn out cells. Given their regenerative abilities, stem cells have the potential of treating a wide variety of diseases. Despite that, there has been controversy surrounding the use of embryonic stem cells – cells derived from embryos that develop from eggs fertilized in vitro, in an in-vitro fertilization (IVF) clinic, and then donated for research purposes. Here are a few arguments FOR and AGAINST embryonic stem cell research."
  ],
  pros: [
    "Stem cells can grow indefinitely in a laboratory and can differentiate into other types of cells; by doing so, stem cells can help treat a range of medical problems such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases.",
    "Embryos are not equivalent to human life as they cannot survive outside the womb. Additionally, more than one third of zygotes do not implant after conception, so more embryos are lost due to chance than to potential research.",
    "In-vitro fertilization (IVF) creates a larger number of unused embryos which are destroyed afterwards. Using them for research would prevent them from being wasted.",
    "Embryonic stem cells are a better alternative to using adult stem cells because they are easier to isolate and grow, they divide much more rapidly, and have more plasticity; this makes it easier to generate larger numbers of cells to treat a wider variety of diseases."    
  ],
  cons: [
    "Embryonic stem cell research is frowned upon by many ethnic and religious groups, whose members believe that an embryo is considered to be a human, therefore claiming that the research is tantamount to murder.",
    "Pro-life supporters also assert that adult stem cells from sources such as the umbilical cord have produced better results, and new advances in technology will soon make the use of embryonic stem cells unnecessary.",
    "Stem cell research in the future can lead to knowledge on how to clone humans, which is seen as a violation of the sanctity of life and goes against the natural order of things.",
    "The consequences of such research are uncertain, and the findings may be misused by groups of people and organizations looking to propagate their cause. In fact, there has been some debate surrounding embryonic stem cell research and its connections to the eugenics (i.e., selective breeding to improve the human race) movement of the last century."
