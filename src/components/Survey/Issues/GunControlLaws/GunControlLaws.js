  description: [
    "Gun control (or firearms regulation) is the set of laws or policies that regulate the manufacture, sale, transfer, possession, or use of firearms by civilians. Most countries have a restrictive firearm guiding policy; however, in some countries, such as the United States (U.S.), the right to bear arms is constitutionally protected, resulting in an elevated rate of gun possession in the U.S. compared to other countries (88.8 guns per 100 people). There is significant debate as to whether more gun control laws should be enacted in order to reduce availability of weapons and potential violence. Here are a few arguments presented by opposite sides of the debate."
    ],
  pros: [
    "The Second Amendment was intended for militia, not domestic/personal use.",
    "Mass shootings, impulsive gun violence (e.g., shooting someone out of anger), and accidental deaths (e.g., children playing with guns) would be significantly reduced if guns were less easily available.",
    "Gun restrictions have always existed and have been successful in reducing violence in other countries (e.g., Australia, Canada).",
    "A majority of Americans, including gun owners, support new gun restrictionsâ€‹."
  ],
  cons: [
    "The Second Amendment was intended to protect everyone's right to bear arms and protect oneself (and family) from danger.",
    "Gun violence is not the result of gun legislation, but people; \"Guns don't kill people, people do.\" If these individuals did not have access to guns, they would use another weapon, such as a knife or a bomb.",
    "There are other solutions to reducing the likelihood/consequences of mass shootings, such as arming school teachers, increasing security on campus, implementing emergency school shooting protocols, and more.",
    "Gun control would not work in the US, it is a part of its culture. Banning guns would be like banning drugs, people will still find a way to get them."
