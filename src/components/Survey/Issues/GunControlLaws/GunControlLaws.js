  problem_statement: "Should gun laws be more strictly enforced by law?",
  image_src: imgSrc,
  description: [
    "The United States has 88.8 guns per 100 people, or about 270,000,000 guns, which is the highest total and per capita number in the world. 22% of Americans own one or more guns (35% of men and 12% of women). America's pervasive gun culture stems in part from its colonial history, revolutionary roots, frontier expansion, and the Second Amendment, which states: \"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\""
  ],
  pros: [
    "The Second Amendment was intended for militia, not domestic/personal use.",
    "Mass shootings, impulsive gun violence (e.g., shooting someone out of anger), and accidental deaths (e.g., children playing with guns) would be significantly reduced if guns were less easily available.",
    "Gun restrictions have always existed and have been successful in reducing violence in other countries (e.g., Australia, Canada).",
    "A majority of Americans, including gun owners, support new gun restrictionsâ€‹."
  ],
  cons: [
    "The Second Amendment was intended to protect everyone's right to bear arms and protect oneself (and family) from danger.",
    "Gun violence is not the result of gun legislation, but people; \"Guns don't kill people, people do.\" If these individuals did not have access to guns, they would use another weapon, such as a knife or a bomb.",
    "There are other solutions to reducing the likelihood/consequences of mass shootings, such as arming school teachers, increasing security on campus, implementing emergency school shooting protocols, and more.",
    "Gun control would not work in the US, it is a part of its culture. Banning guns would be like banning drugs, people will still find a way to get them."
