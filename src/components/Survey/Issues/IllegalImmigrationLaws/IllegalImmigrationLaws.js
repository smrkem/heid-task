  description: [    
    "Illegal immigration is on the rise in Canada. In 2017, 50440 asylum claims were made. It should be noted that seeking asylum applies to legal application processes of immigration as well, but currently Canada has more illegal applicants than legal. A major reason for this is the deportation of illegal immigrants in the USA. Controversy stems from whether illegal immigrants are an economic burden or asset, as well as concerns on the leniency of government policy. Here are a few arguments FOR and AGAINST strict enforcing strict illegal immigration laws."    
  ],
  pros: [
    "Providing legal status will allow illegal immigrants to get higher paying jobs, and consequently boost the economy.",
    "Mass deportations would cause a significant economic strain â€“ both on the costs of finding and deporting illegal immigrants, and in the loss of part of the workforce.",
    "Illegal immigrants are not a significant source of terrorism. In the USA, foreigners that have carried out terrorist attacks have entered the country primarily through various forms of legal immigration (work/tourist visas, etc).",
    "It is cruel and inhumane to separate families that have legal and illegal members."    
  ],
  cons: [
    "Illegal immigration is a burden for society and take jobs away from legal citizens or immigrants.",
    "The illegal act of entering the country should not be rewarded by providing a legal status.",
    "It slows down the process of people legally attempting to enter the country via asylum claims.",
    "Illegal immigrants are an economic burden because they may access social services. This both slows the process of and reduces the resources available to legal citizens and immigrants accessing the same services."
