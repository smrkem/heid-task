  description: [
    "Marijuana legalization refers to the practice of allowing and regulating the production, distribution, sale, and possession of cannabis so that marijuana use within the established rules is no longer a crime. There are different models of legalization, ranging from allowing people to grow their own marijuana to nonprofit co-ops to for-profit commercialization with retail sales. People differ on their position on whether marijuana should be legalized."
