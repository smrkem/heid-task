  description: [
    "Black Lives Matter is an international activist movement originating in the United States that campaigns against violence and systemic racism towards black people. The movement began with the use of the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager, in February 2012. Since, there have been over 2000 #BlackLivesMatter protests worldwide, including the U.S., England, Canada, Australia, and Ghana, as well as several high-profile statements, such as professional athletes sitting during the national anthem, as opposed to the tradition of standing (a symbol of national pride), in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The protests and these types of acts have generated mixed reactions. Here are a few arguments FOR and AGAINST whether the Black Lives Movement is “good” for America and other countries."
  ],
  pros: [
    "There is evidence of systemic, discriminatory practices in law enforcement wherein black males are twice as likely to be shot or arrested for drug offences than white males.",
    "There is evidence of racial inequality that persist in education and economic opportunity; for instance, even after considering positive factors such as increased education levels, black families have less wealth on average than white families.",
    "Collectively, the Black Lives Matter protests have lead to local and national changes; for instance, protests have led to negative publicity and subsequent loss of power for politicians and attorneys that have been involved in failures to prosecute police officers involved in the shooting of “innocent” black suspects (e.g., Trayvon Martin).",
    "It has been reported that both implicit and explicit racism and pro-white bias decreased during the Black Lives Matter campaign."
  ],
  cons: [
    "This movement is dismissive because “All Lives Matter.” It ignores the fact that other minorities have been discriminated against in the past, and it is unfair to focus on only one group as deserving of protests.",
    "The Black Lives Matter movement is divisive because it argues for racial divides which strengthen the notion that people of various ethnicities are different.",
    "It is sometimes unclear what the objective of Black Lives Matter is, and many people believe that the movement condones violence exhibited by black people.",
    "It incites violence especially towards the police, including three ambush murders of multiple officers in New York, Baton Rouge, and Dallas from 2014 to 2016."
