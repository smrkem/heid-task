  description: [
    "Having an unintended pregnancy is common in the US and Canada, and it is estimated that 4 out of 10 people will decide to have an abortion to end the pregnancy. Abortion procedures under medical supervision generally consist of surgical abortions (e.g.,  suction aspiration, hysterotomy) or medical abortions (e.g., saline abortions, drugs) to support the termination of a pregnancy. There is considerable debate as to whether abortions are immoral and whether they should be considered legal at any stage in a womenâ€™s pregnancy. Here are a few arguments presented by opposite sides of the debate."
  ],
  pros: [
    "Women have a right and the freedom to choose whether to have a child or not.",
    "Reproductive choice empowers women by giving them control over what happens to their bodies - not forced to bring into the world a child that is unwanted perhaps due to sexual crimes or genetic abnormalities.",
    "If legal abortions were not provided, women would attempt to do via unsafe, illegal abortions that could cause significant harm, including death",
    "Many of the women who choose abortion don't have the financial resources to support a child; reduce welfare costs to tax payers."
  ],
  cons: [
    "Life begins at conception, so abortions are murder and the killing of an innocent human being is wrong, even if that human being has yet to be born; human being have a right to life.",
    "Women should not be able to use abortion as a form of contraception; it is immoral to kill an unborn child for convenience and they should accept the responsibility that comes with producing a child.",
    "Abortions also eliminate the potential of a future human-being to contribute to a society. Famous people whose mothers declined the advice to have an abortion include: Celine Dion, Justin Bieber and Tim Tebow.",
    "Abortions are a sin according to certain religions."
