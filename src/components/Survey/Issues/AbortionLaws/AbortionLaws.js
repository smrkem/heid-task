  description: [
    "Having an unintended pregnancy is common in the US and Canada, and it is estimated that 4 out of 10 people will decide to have an abortion to end the pregnancy. Abortion procedures under medical supervision are generally very safe and consist of surgical abortion (e.g.: suction aspiration, hysterotomy) or medical abortions (e.g.: saline abortions, drugs) to support the premature ending of a pregnancy. Inducing an abortion was a crime in Canada until 1988 and in the US until 1973, when abortion laws were determined to be \"unconstitutional\". Since then, abortion has been legal at any stage in a woman's pregnancy in Canada and is publicly funded as a medical procedure. However, access to abortion services differ across these countries and abortion remains one of the most divisive political issues of our time."

  pros: [
    "Women have a right and the freedom to choose whether to have a child or not.",
    "Reproductive choice empowers women by giving them control over what happens to their bodies - not forced to bring into the world a child that is unwanted perhaps due to sexual crimes or genetic abnormalities.",
    "If legal abortions were not provided, women would attempt to do via unsafe, illegal abortions that could cause significant harm, including death",
    "Many of the women who choose abortion don't have the financial resources to support a child; reduce welfare costs to tax payers."

  cons: [
    "Life begins at conception, so abortions are murder and the killing of an innocent human being is wrong, even if that human being has yet to be born; human being have a right to life.",
    "Women should not be able to use abortion as a form of contraception; it is immoral to kill an unborn child for convenience and they should accept the responsibility that comes with producing a child.",
    "Abortions also eliminate the potential of a future human-being to contribute to a society. Famous people whose mothers declined the advice to have an abortion include: Celine Dion, Justin Bieber and Tim Tebow.",
    "Abortions are a sin according to certain religions."
