  description: [
    "The burqa is a garment for women that completely covers the body and face, allowing space only for the eyes to see. It originates from islamic traditions in order to preserve the modesty of a woman. Controversy over whether the burqa should be banned has been debated due concerns of safety, religious freedom, and womenâ€™s rights. Here are a few arguments FOR and AGAINST banning the burqa."
  ],
  pros: [
    "Burqas are an oppressive symbol of women's subjugation to men and of viewing women as second-class citizens.",
    "The burqa restricts a woman's right to express herself.", 
    "A woman that no longer wishes to wear the burqa may do so more freely, without being ostracized or threatened by her community since most women would no longer be wearing it.",
    "From a security point of view, face and body covering can facilitate various acts of violence and lawlessness."
  ],
  cons: [
    "Banning the burqa goes against freedom of religion and singles out Muslims as problematic. Otherwise, why are Christians not forbidden to wear a cross or Jews forbidden from wearing yarmulkes (the ritual head coverings worn by devout Jewish men)?", 
    "Muslim women wear the burqas by choice. It is part of their religion and culture.", 
    "This is also a matter of individual freedom. Who appointed the State to tell us how to (and not to) dress?", 
    "Countries are made stronger by diversity. Countries can preserve their heritage while welcoming practices from Muslim countries."
