  problem_statement: "Should women have the right to wear the burqa?",
  image_src: imgSrc,
  description: [
    "The burqa is a garment for women that completely covers the body and face, allowing space only for the eyes to see. It originates from islamic traditions in order to preserve the modesty of a woman. Controversy over whether the burqa should be banned has been debated due concerns of safety, religious freedom, and women’s rights."
  ],
  pros: [
    "Burqas should be banned because they are an oppressive way of males to control a woman’s behaviour.",
    "The notion that a males lust must be protected against by wearing certain clothing is a form of restricting a woman in expressing herself. As such, banning the burqa will liberate women from this oppressive practice.",
    "A woman that does not want to wear a burqa may be ostracized or threatened by her community if she stops wearing it, bringing further shame, embarrassment and oppression. Banning the burqa would remove this situation from occurring.",
    "Burqas provide a way for criminals and terrorists to disguise themselves. As such, it is a safety concern that must be dealt with."
  ],
  cons: [
    "There is no rule in the Quran about wearing a burqa, so it is up to the woman to make the choice.",
    "Removing the ability to choose the burqa as an option for women that wish to preserve their modesty can also make them feel objectified and subjugated by sexist patriarchal oppression.",
    "The notion that wearing a burqa acts as a good disguise for terrorists or criminals is a discriminatory statement. For example, when a Jewish nun wears a Kippah, another head covering, it is seen as devout.",
    "Banning the burqa specifically is discriminatory and reflects a poor perception and respect of Islamic traditions."
