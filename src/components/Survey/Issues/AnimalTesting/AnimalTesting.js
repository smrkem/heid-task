  description: [
    "Approximately 26 million animals are used every year in the United States for commercial or scientific testing. Animals are used in commercial and scientific testing as a way to determine the safety of biomedical, commercial or healthcare products. Scientifically, animals have also been used in various behavioural experiments as well. Here are a few arguments FOR and AGAINST animal testing."    
  ],
  pros: [
    "Research involving animal testing has overall provided improved healthcare for animals and humans alike.",
    "Animal research has led to breakthroughs such as the creation of various vaccines, pacemakers, and cochlear implants.",
    "There are strict restrictions against mistreating animals in laboratories.",
    "Animals are only used for research purposes when there are no other alternatives available."
  ],
  cons: [
    "It is a cruel and inhumane practice.",
    "Animals do not get many of the diseases we do, such as Parkinson's disease, major types of heart disease, and many types of cancer, Alzheimer's disease, HIV or schizophrenia.",
    "Animals are not given a choice in the matter.",
    "There has been little success in generalizing research findings on animals to humans. 90% of drugs fail in human trials despite promising results in animal tests."
