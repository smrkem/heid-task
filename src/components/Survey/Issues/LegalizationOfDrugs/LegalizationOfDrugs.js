  description: [
    "The call for legalization of all drugs comes after the realization that prohibition does little to stop people, especially youth, from getting the drugs. Here are a few arguments FOR and AGAINST the legalization of all drugs."
  ],
  pros: [
    "There is evidence around the world that the war on drugs is a failure, and the law enforcement approach doesn’t do anything to deter addicts and users; instead, users are stigmatized, which in turn prevents them from seeking help.",
    "Taking away the criminal element can reduce drugs use and the resulting deaths. For example, in 2001, Portugal decriminalized possession and use of all drugs, leading to a decrease in teen drug use, overdoses, and death.",
    "If drugs are regulated and can be bought in stores, they are safer. Even a small amount of a powerful drug such as Fentanyl mixed in with other drugs sold by a dealer, can cause an overdose and death. Additionally, the introduction of safe injection sites, which aims to tackle the current opioid crisis, has saved and continues to save many lives, and supports those struggling with addiction.",
    "Enforcing drug laws is costly. In 2002, in cost Canadians over $1 billion dollars to enforce cannabis laws alone. Drug use and abuse is a social issue, and that money could instead be directed toward employment and social support initiatives for at-risk individuals."    
  ],
  cons: [
    "There is a good reason some drugs are illegal. They have a very powerful effect on an individual’s mental and physical well-being, and can cause irreversible damage to their body.",
    "The danger of drug use and abuse is not limited to the consumers, so it goes beyond a matter of personal choice. For example, impaired judgment and decision-making, as well as slower reaction-time and increased thrill-seeking behaviors associated with certain drugs can result in violent outbursts toward innocent others, and an increased incidence of car accidents.",
    "Legalization will give people access to drugs that otherwise would not be easily available. This poses a particular problem when it comes to young people who like to experience new things, especially under peer pressure. Biologically, some people are more prone to addiction, and even a single event can lead to devastating, long-term consequences.",
    "Just like the legal ownership of guns in the United States sometimes leads to children’s accidental deaths, easy access to drugs at home, especially when the parent is under influence, can lead to injury and death of a young person."
