  description: [
    "Euthanasia, or physician assisted suicide, is the practice of ending an ill person's life upon their request to relieve intractable suffering. Euthanasia is legal in Canada as of 2016 for terminally ill adults. However, it requires repeated explicit consent, including right at the moment before death. There are many arguments for and against legalizing euthanasia, such that it is illegal in most countries in the world. Here are a few arguments FOR and AGAINST legalizing euthanasia."    
  ],
  pros: [
    "Every patient has a right to choose when to die.",
    "Allowing people to ‘die with dignity’ in a quick and painless death is kinder than forcing them to continue their lives with suffering.",
    "Euthanasia can be safely regulated by government legislation.",
    "It is less expensive than lifelong treatment."
  ],
  cons: [
    "Terminally ill people may not be in the right state of mind to give consent.",
    "In the Netherlands in 1990, it is estimated that 1000 patients were killed without their request.",
    "Opening the doors to voluntary euthanasia could lead to non-voluntary and involuntary euthanasia, by giving doctors the power to decide when a patient’s life is not worth living.",
    "Life is precious and should be preserved. Suicide is immoral."
