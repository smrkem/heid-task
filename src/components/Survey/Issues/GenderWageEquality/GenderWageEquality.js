  description: [
    "The gender wage gap is the difference in earnings between men and women in the workplace. There are three ways the wage gap is measured. First, by comparing annual earnings of full time and part time workers of both genders. Second, by comparing the annual earnings of full time workers only. Lastly, by comparing the hourly wages of full time and part time workers. In general, these reports suggest that women earn an average of 87 cents to every dollar a male earns, and there is a disproportionate amount of women in lower paying jobs than men. Debate on this topic extends to beliefs on reasons why the gap exists, whether there is in fact equal opportunity for all, and whether affirmative action (giving women preferential treatment in employment) is fair/justified."
  ],
  pros: [
    "Differences in earnings for men and women are founded in systematic, discriminatory practices.",
    "A lack of affordable child-care and family leave policies force women to work more part-time positions than men.",
    "The wage gap is amplified by the societal expectation that a woman should stay at home and take care of a child or children.",
    "Society should work towards promoting women into higher wage jobs, STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) careers, recognize and combat gender",
    "Stereotypes in the workplace, and have government/businesses offer better child care or leave policies."
  ],
  cons: [
    "Experience may play a role in why one person gets paid more than the other despite having the same role.",
    "Women have the same choice of working in a high paying, lucrative industry as men.",
    "Since there are policies in place that prevent unequal pay for the same work, the gender wage cannot exist.",
    "Women are more skillful at jobs involving care-taking and are more likely to be hired at part-time positions within that field. Thus, resulting in lower wage as a part-time worker."
