  description: [
    "The gender wage gap is the difference in earnings between men and women in the workplace. In general, reports suggest that women earn an average of 87 cents to every dollar a male earns, and there is a disproportionate amount of women in lower paying jobs than men. Debate on this topic extends to beliefs on reasons why the gap exists, whether there is in fact unequal opportunities between genders, and whether legislation – such as affirmative action (giving women preferential treatment in employment) – should replace merit-based systems where employment and salaries are based on performance not gender. Here are a few arguments presented by opposite sides of the debate."
  ],
  pros: [
    "Differences in earnings for men and women are founded in systematic, discriminatory practices.",
    "A lack of affordable child-care and family leave policies force women to work more part-time positions than men.",
    "The wage gap is amplified by the societal expectation that a woman should stay at home and take care of a child or children.",
    "Society should work towards promoting women into higher wage jobs, STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) careers, recognize and combat gender"
  ],
  cons: [
    "Experience may play a role in why one person gets paid more than the other despite having the same role.",
    "Women have the same choice of working in a high paying, lucrative industry as men.",
    "Since there are policies in place that prevent unequal pay for the same work, the gender wage cannot exist.",
    "Women are more skillful at jobs involving care-taking and are more likely to be hired at part-time positions within that field. Thus, resulting in lower wage as a part-time worker."
