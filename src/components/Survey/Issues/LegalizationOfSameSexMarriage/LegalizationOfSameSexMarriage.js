  description: [
    "In 2001, the Netherlands became the first country to legalize same-sex marriage. In 2005, Canada became the fourth country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage. In 2015, USA legalized same sex-marriage. Support for same-sex unions continues to be mixed. Controversy on the topic include varied beliefs on the “limits of rights”, freedom of choice, religious doctrine, and equality. Here are a few arguments FOR and AGAINST legalizing same-sex marriages."
  ],
  pros: [
    "Equality extends to the right of who an individual wants to marry; denying this right is a discriminatory, homophobic act.",
    "Allowing same-sex marriages will help reduce stigma against homosexuals.",
    "The government should not be involved in the private affairs of its people. As such, they should hold no restrictions over topics such as marriage.",
    "Same-sex marriages also increase the amount of orphans adopted."
  ],
  cons: [
    "Marriage should remain a union between a man and a female because marriage is a pragmatic union built for procreation. Violating this would weaken the sanctity of heterosexual relationships.",
    "There are multiple religious beliefs that forbid such unions. Allowing gay marriage would weaken religion, which plays a foundational role in communities and society.",
    "If society were to extend the equal rights for same-sex marriage that heterosexual marriages have, then the same rights should be applied to polygamous or incestuous relationships. Since this does not occur, certain rights do have limits.",
    "It is common sense that heterosexual relationships are not natural in that a child cannot be produced."
