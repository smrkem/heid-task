  description: [
    "The Me Too movement (or #MeToo movement) is a movement against sexual harassment and sexual assault in the workplace, music industry, sciences, academia, and politics. The hashtag #MeToo spread virally in October 2017 on social media where victims could share publicly their #MeToo stories in an attempt to demonstrate the widespread prevalence of sexual assault and harassment. It followed soon after the sexual misconduct allegations against Harvey Weinstein. Alyssa Milano, one of the founders of the movement, encouraged victims of sexual harassment to tweet about it and &quot;give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem&quot;. This was met with success, with more than 12 million #MeToo related posts during the first 24 hours on Facebook and Twitter, including some high-profile posts from several American celebrities (e.g.,Gwyneth Paltrow, Uma Thurman, Jennifer Lawrence) describing their #MeToo stories accusing men of sexual assault. Despite the hype, there have been significant concerns raised about the #MeToo movement. Here are a few arguments FOR and AGAINST posting reports of sexual harassment and assault claims online."
  ],
  pros: [
    "Social media gives many otherwise marginalized people a powerful voice, and has been successful in raising awareness of sexual assault and how widespread it’s become. When others speak up about their past abuse, others are more likely to come forward to the authorities and take appropriate action.",
    "Several high-powered men have been accused of sexual assault via the Me Too movement, leading to further victims coming forward with their #MeToo stories and, eventually, a number of these men have been convicted of sexual assault (e.g., Bill Crosby, gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar).",
    "It gives the opportunity for society to change its standards regarding sexual harassment. The “boys will be boys” logic should no longer be valid; instead, women should be treated with respect, and not be objectified the way they have been for decades.",
    "The movement has forced many employers to make changes in response to #MeToo, for example examining gender-based pay differences and improving sexual harassment policies."
  ],
  cons: [
    "The movement may have gone too far. It can create a mob mentality in which people largely succumb to the pressure of conforming to the group, and supporting their friends’ and role models’ opinions rather than having their own.",
    "Accusations are thrown around way too easily, and every accused is now “guilty until proven innocent.” Many innocent men may find themselves under fire, and can even witness their life get destroyed because of false allegations.",
    "Everyone has the right to defend themselves, but this should happen in a courtroom with an unbiased audience, rather than the quick-to-judge internet presence.",
    "Fake reports may be posted by people with certain political agendas, discrediting the whole movement and making it unlikely that any genuine reports will be taken seriously in the future."
