      In this task, you will review a number of controversial social topics where people tend to be 
      either <b>FOR</b> or <b>AGAINST</b> these issues (e.g., same-sex marriage, animal testing, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>The goal is to understand which social issues  are <b>MOST IMPORTANT TO YOU</b> and what <b>YOU BELIEVE IN</b> 
      (e.g., are you FOR or AGAINST this issue). You will be asked to complete three exercises in this task that will help us identify a final social issue that appears important to you and that you are most motivated to fight for in the next task. 
    </p>

    <p>
      There are no right or wrong answers. What social issues you value are very individual; values are not based on what others expect of us or what we think we should be doing. They are based on what you believe in, what is truly important and meaningful to you.
    </p>

    <p>
      We realize that not all social values are equally popular in today's society. Please be aware that your responses will be completely de-identified and there will be no link between your value choices and your personal identity. What is most important is that you answer honestly from your own perspective, rather than what you think is socially desirable.
